### ACC
---
In Palo Alto Networks firewalls, the "ACC" section refers to the "Application Command Center." The Application Command Center is a feature of Palo Alto Networks' firewall management interface that provides visual representations and insights into application and threat activity on the network.

The ACC section offers various interactive dashboards and reports that help administrators monitor and analyze network traffic, applications, and threats in real-time. It enables administrators to gain a deeper understanding of network usage, application behavior, and security events.

Key features and components of the ACC section include:

1. Dashboards: The ACC provides pre-configured dashboards that present visual summaries and metrics related to application usage, threat activity, URL categories, data filtering, and more. Dashboards offer at-a-glance insights into network behavior and security posture.
    
2. Custom Reports: Administrators can create custom reports within the ACC section, allowing them to tailor the information and visualization to their specific needs. Custom reports can focus on specific applications, users, threats, or other network attributes.
    
3. Application Visibility: The ACC provides detailed visibility into the applications traversing the network. It classifies network traffic into specific applications, irrespective of the port or protocol used. This helps administrators understand the application landscape and make informed decisions about network policies and resource allocation.
    
4. Threat Monitoring: The ACC section highlights security threats and provides information about the types of threats detected, the frequency of occurrences, and the affected hosts. Administrators can quickly identify potential security incidents and take appropriate actions to mitigate them.
    
5. URL Filtering: The ACC offers insights into URL filtering, categorizing and displaying web traffic based on the URL categories defined in the firewall's security policies. This allows administrators to monitor web activity and identify potential policy violations or risky user behavior.
    

The ACC section is designed to provide administrators with actionable intelligence and real-time visibility into application and threat activity within their network. It helps them make informed decisions regarding network security policies, application performance optimization, and overall network management.

It's important to note that the specific features and capabilities within the ACC section may vary depending on the Palo Alto Networks firewall model and the software version running on the firewall.

### Policies 
---
[back to top](#sections%20of%20palo%20alto%20gui)
In Palo Alto Networks firewalls, the "Policies" section refers to a component within the firewall's management interface that allows administrators to define and manage security policies. These policies control and enforce network traffic based on a set of predefined rules and conditions.

The Policies section typically includes the following types of policies:

1. Security Policies: Security policies define the rules for allowing or denying network traffic based on various criteria, including source and destination addresses, ports, applications, and users. Administrators can create policies to allow specific traffic, block certain applications, or apply security measures like antivirus scanning or URL filtering. Security policies are a fundamental aspect of network security and help protect the network from unauthorized access, threats, and data breaches.
    
2. NAT (Network Address Translation) Policies: NAT policies define how network address translation should be performed for inbound and outbound traffic. They enable the translation of IP addresses and ports to facilitate communication between different IP networks, public and private IP spaces, or to ensure compatibility with specific applications or protocols.
    
3. QoS (Quality of Service) Policies: QoS policies prioritize and control network traffic based on defined rules and conditions. They allow administrators to allocate bandwidth, manage congestion, and ensure optimal performance for critical applications or services. QoS policies help enforce service level agreements (SLAs) and maintain network performance and reliability.
    
4. Decryption Policies: Decryption policies define which network traffic should be decrypted for inspection and analysis. With decryption policies, administrators can enforce SSL/TLS decryption to inspect encrypted traffic for potential threats, malware, or policy violations. These policies define the rules and criteria for selecting which traffic to decrypt and inspect.
    

The Policies section provides a centralized interface for administrators to create, manage, and organize these policies. It allows them to define rules, specify action, order the policies, and monitor their effectiveness. Administrators can tailor the policies to match their specific security requirements, network architecture, and compliance standards.

By defining and implementing policies in Palo Alto Networks firewalls, administrators can enforce security measures, control network traffic, prevent unauthorized access, and ensure proper network functionality and performance.


### Objects
---
[back to top](#sections%20of%20palo%20alto%20gui)

In Palo Alto Networks' Panorama, the "Objects" section refers to a component within the platform that allows administrators to define and manage various reusable network and security objects. These objects simplify the configuration and management of network policies, firewall rules, and security settings across multiple Palo Alto Networks firewalls.

Within the Objects section of Panorama, administrators can define and organize different types of objects, including:

1. Address Objects: These objects represent specific IP addresses, subnets, or IP address ranges. They can be used to define source or destination addresses in firewall rules, NAT policies, or security profiles.
    
2. Service Objects: Service objects define specific ports or port ranges associated with network services or protocols. They are utilized to define source or destination ports in firewall rules and security policies.
    
3. Security Profiles: These objects define the settings and parameters for various security features, such as antivirus, anti-spyware, URL filtering, or file blocking. Security profiles can be assigned to firewall policies to provide comprehensive security enforcement.
    
4. Zones: Zones represent logical groupings of interfaces or network segments within the network infrastructure. They are used to simplify policy creation by associating interfaces with specific zones rather than individual IP addresses.
    
5. Custom Objects: Panorama also allows the creation of custom objects, which provide flexibility for administrators to define specific network or security-related objects tailored to their environment. This can include application groups, URL categories, or custom threat signatures.
    

By defining and managing these objects within Panorama, administrators can establish a centralized repository of reusable network and security definitions. This simplifies the configuration and consistency across multiple Palo Alto Networks firewalls managed by Panorama, allowing for more efficient and streamlined network management.

The Objects section in Panorama provides a consolidated view and management interface for these objects, enabling administrators to easily create, modify, and apply them to the respective policies and configurations deployed across the managed firewall devices.
