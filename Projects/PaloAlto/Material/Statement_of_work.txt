Aaron, nice work on the AWS lab.  For your next project, you are going to be working 
with a Palo Alto firewall.

For this project you are going to be utilizing the environment you built for the 
Infoblox lab. In the LLD for that project there is a Firewall between the MLS 
switches ad your Edge router, you will be placing the PA-VM device in that spot, 
connect the three devices to the FW (make them L3 connections, use subnets of your 
own design), and remove the two existing links between the edge router and the MLS 
switches (aka the bypass links).  

You will also need a PC with a browser to connect to the PA's management interface. 
I recommend adding the Ubuntu Desktop Guest from the GNS3 marketplace.  Configure the 
PC and the Palo's management (must be done from CLI) interface to point to each other.  
Use that PC to access the GUI for the palo, where you will need to setup the Palo's 
routing, and set 2 security policies to allow traffic through.

inside -> outside allow any any
outside -> inside allow any any

Once you have verified that you have connectivity from your end users to the internet 
check in with a mentor and we will discuss the security objectives that we want you 
to design policies for.

The target date for completion for the entire project will be 6/23
These are the modifications you will need to make to the respective devices
