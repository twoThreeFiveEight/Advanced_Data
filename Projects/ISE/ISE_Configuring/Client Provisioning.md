In the context of Cisco's Identity Services Engine (ISE), client provisioning refers to the process of preparing and equipping network client devices with the necessary software so they can successfully connect to the network.

Client Provisioning in ISE generally involves:

1. **Posture assessment:** This is a process where the ISE checks the security posture of the connecting device. It verifies that the device complies with the organization's security policies, which might include things like ensuring certain antivirus or firewall software is installed and up-to-date, certain system updates are installed, etc.
    
2. **Remediation:** If the posture assessment finds that a client device does not meet the security policy, ISE can often help to remediate this. For example, if a device doesn't have the necessary antivirus software, the ISE can provide a link to download it.
    
3. **Configuration:** ISE can also help configure client devices for the network. This might involve things like setting up 802.1X settings, VPN settings, Wi-Fi settings, etc.
    
4. **Software Installation:** In some cases, ISE can also help install necessary software on the client device. For example, it might install the AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client, which is used for secure VPN connections.
    

These features are often handled using the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client and its associated modules, or other supplicant software, in combination with ISE. The ISE is able to deliver these software and updates to client devices through a Client Provisioning Portal.

Through this client provisioning process, ISE helps ensure that client devices are not only secure but also properly configured for network access, reducing the administrative burden of manual configuration and improving the overall security posture of the network
