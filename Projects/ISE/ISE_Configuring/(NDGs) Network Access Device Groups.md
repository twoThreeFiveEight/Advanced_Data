Network Access Device (NAD) Groups in Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) offer a mechanism to manage and categorize network devices like routers, switches, and firewalls. These groups help apply uniform policies or configurations to multiple devices simultaneously. Grouping can be based on device type, location, or role, providing flexibility in managing network access policies across the network.
