- Today we will be going over the 802.1X protocol.  The 802.1X protocol is an industry-standard network access control protocol (NAC) that provides port-based authentication and authorization for devices attempting to connect to a network. 
- It enhances network security by preventing unauthorized access and ensuring that only authenticated and authorized devices are allowed to connect. 
- With 802.1X, a client device must authenticate itself before being granted access to the network. This authentication process typically involves the exchange of EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol) messages between the client, the authenticator (such as a switch or access point), and the authentication server. 802.1X is commonly used in wired and wireless network environments to enforce access control, apply security policies, and facilitate secure communication.

- We will now walk through the authentication process

- First the client (supplicant) connects to the network and sends an EAP-Start message to the authenticator device. The EAP-Start message is usually triggered by the client's attempt to access a network service, such as connecting to a Wi-Fi network. The supplicant will send EAP request as well as listen for the EAP response on a a designated MAC address as the destination. (01:80:C2:00:00:03) 

- The authenticator device receives the EAP-Start message from the client and acts as a proxy or intermediary between the client and the authentication server. It forwards the EAP-Start message to the authentication server, indicating that the client wants to initiate the authentication process. CLICK

- If PEAP (Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol) is used like in our example a PEAP tunnel will be established through the TLS protocol to protect the credentials exchanged in our authentication process.

- The authentication server, which is responsible for verifying the client's credentials and making authentication decisions, receives the EAP-Start message from the authenticator device. It then starts the authentication process by sending an EAP-Request message back to the authenticator.

CLICK and talk while moving 
- The authenticator device relays the EAP-Request message from the authentication server to the client. This EAP-Request message typically asks the client to provide its identity information, In our case the digital certificate.

- The client responds to the EAP-Request message by sending an EAP-Response message back to the authenticator device. The EAP-Response message contains the requested identity information or other authentication-related data. This packet is contained inside the 802.1x frame

- The authenticator device continues to act as a proxy, encapsulating the 802.1x frame into a RADIUS frame ***CLICK*** and forwarding the EAP-Request and EAP-Response messages between the client and the authentication server. 

CLICK
- The authentication server will look at the credential and compare this the the Identity store AKA data base for a match. If a match is found a Access-Accept message is sent back. 

CLICK
At this point I need to point out a couple Caveats. 
- First In this example we will show a single request and response followed by authentication Access-Acceptance approval but know that A RADIUS access-Challenge response maybe sent from the Authentication server requesting additional information this back and forth process this process may continues until the authentication server reaches a decision and responds with an EAP-Success or EAP-Failure message. 

- Second The information regarding the user's identity and attributes is usually exchanged separately between the authentication server and the authenticator during the EAP authentication process. These attributes can be used by the authenticator to enforce access control policies or configure the client's network session. in our example we sent the attributes with the approval for simplicity. 

CLICK
- Once the Authorization Access-Accept message has been received the supplicants port will now be authorized.

- This concludes our example of the 802.1x authentication process




- The authenticator then encapsulates this Identity response in a [RADIUS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RADIUS "RADIUS") Access-Request packet and forwards it on to the authentication server

- It is important to note With more complex authentication dialogs an additional request for information from the user such as a secondary password, PIN, token, or card may be asked.
