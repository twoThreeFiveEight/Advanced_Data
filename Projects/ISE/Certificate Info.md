---
A Certificate Signing Request (CSR) is a block of encoded text that is given to a Certificate Authority (CA) when applying for an SSL (Secure Socket Layer) Certificate. It's generated on the server where the certificate will be installed and contains information that will be included in the certificate such as the organization name, common name (domain name), locality, and country. It also contains the public key that will be included in the certificate. A private key is also created at the same time you create the CSR.

Here are the general steps to create a CSR:

1. **Generate a Key Pair**: This involves creating a private and a public key. The private key should be kept secure and private while the public key will be included in the CSR.
    
2. **Create the CSR**: This can typically be done using server software or a tool such as OpenSSL. When creating the CSR, you'll be asked for various pieces of information including your company name, your domain name (common name), your country, etc.
    
3. **Submit the CSR to a Certificate Authority (CA)**: The CA will validate the information in the CSR and your identity, and if everything checks out, they will issue an SSL certificate for your domain.
    
4. **Install the Certificate**: Once the CA has issued the certificate, you can install it on your server. The server will match the certificate to the private key to create a secure connection.
    

Remember, the private key must be kept safe. If someone else has your private key, they can potentially use it to decrypt your secure communications.
