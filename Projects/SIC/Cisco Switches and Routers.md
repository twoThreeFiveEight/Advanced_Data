Cisco offers several series of switches that align with the hierarchical tier design. While specific series numbers may vary over time as new models are introduced, here are some commonly associated series for each layer:

#### 1.  Core Layer:
---
- Cisco Nexus 9000 Series
- Cisco Catalyst 6800 Series (supervisor modules)
- **Catalyst 9600 Switches** — modular edge, core and distribution (secure, resilient campus)
- **Catalyst 9500 Switches** — ﬁxed edge, core and distribution (secure, resilient campus)
    
#### 2.  Distribution Layer:
----
- Cisco Catalyst 4500 Series (supervisor modules)
- Cisco Nexus 7000 Series
- Cisco Nexus 5000 Series
- **Catalyst 9400 Switches** — modular access and distribution (secure, resilient   campus)

#### 3.  Access Layer:
----   
-  **Catalyst 9300 Switches** — ﬁxed, stackable access and distribution (secure branch and business-critical campus)
-   **Catalyst 9200 Switches** — ﬁxed, stackable and compact access (simple branch)
-   Cisco Catalyst 3650 Series
-   Cisco Catalyst 2960 Series

It's important to note that the series listed above are just a few examples, and Cisco continually introduces new models and series to meet evolving network requirements. Additionally, some switch series can be deployed across multiple layers depending on the specific use case and network design.

To obtain the most up-to-date and comprehensive information on Cisco switch series and their alignment with the hierarchical tier design, it is recommended to visit the official Cisco website or consult with Cisco representatives.
