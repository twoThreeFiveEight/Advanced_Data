The Nexus switch is a series of switches designed and manufactured by Cisco Systems. It is specifically built for data center environments and is known for its high performance, scalability, and advanced features tailored for demanding enterprise applications.

The Cisco Nexus switch series offers a range of models with varying capabilities to meet different data center requirements. Some key features and characteristics of the Nexus switches include:

1.  High Performance: Nexus switches are designed to handle large data flows and provide low-latency, high-bandwidth connectivity within data center networks. They often support high-density 10 Gigabit Ethernet (GbE) and 40/100 GbE interfaces.
    
2.  Unified Fabric: Nexus switches leverage Cisco's Unified Fabric technology, which combines Ethernet and Fibre Channel traffic onto a single network fabric. This simplifies network architecture and reduces infrastructure costs by eliminating the need for separate Ethernet and Fibre Channel networks.
    
3.  Virtualization Support: Nexus switches provide extensive support for virtualization technologies, such as Virtual Port Channels (vPC) and Virtual Extensible LAN (VXLAN). These features enable efficient and scalable deployment of virtual machines (VMs) across multiple physical servers.
    
4.  Fabric Extenders: Nexus switches can be used in conjunction with Cisco Nexus Fabric Extenders (FEX), also known as Fabric Extender Modules (FEX or FEX modules). FEX modules extend the Nexus switch's ports and management capabilities to access layer switches, providing a simplified and scalable network design.
    
5.  Data Center Bridging: Nexus switches support Data Center Bridging (DCB) technologies, including Priority Flow Control (PFC) and Enhanced Transmission Selection (ETS). DCB enhances network performance, reliability, and Quality of Service (QoS) for data center applications.
    
6.  Advanced Features: Nexus switches offer a wide range of advanced features such as advanced security capabilities, deep buffer memory, MPLS support, support for Software-Defined Networking (SDN) solutions like Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI), and extensive management and monitoring capabilities.
    

The Cisco Nexus switch series is widely used in enterprise data centers, cloud service providers, and other environments where high performance, reliability, and scalability are critical. They are designed to meet the demanding needs of modern data centers, including virtualization, high-density computing, big data, and cloud-based applications.
