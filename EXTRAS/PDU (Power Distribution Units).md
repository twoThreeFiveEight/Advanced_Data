PDUs are devices mounted on a rack that provide electrical power distribution to various networking and server equipment within a data center or server room. They are designed to supply power to multiple devices simultaneously and often offer additional features for power management and monitoring.

Here are some key features and functionalities commonly found in rack-mounted PDUs:

1. Power Outlets: PDUs have multiple power outlets or receptacles where the networking devices can be connected. These outlets may support different types of power plugs, such as NEMA, IEC, or regional-specific standards.
    
2. Input Power Connections: PDUs are connected to the main power source, such as a wall outlet or a power distribution panel, through input power connections. These connections can vary based on the specific PDU model and regional power standards.
    
3. Power Control: PDUs usually include switches or buttons that allow individual or grouped power control for the connected devices. This enables administrators to power on, power off, or reset specific devices remotely or locally.
    
4. Power Monitoring: Many PDUs offer power monitoring capabilities, providing real-time data on power consumption, voltage, current, and other power-related metrics. This information helps in capacity planning, energy efficiency, and identifying potential issues.
    
5. Power Management: Advanced PDUs may include features for power management, such as load balancing, outlet grouping, scheduled power cycling, or remote management interfaces (e.g., network interfaces or SNMP support).
    
6. Redundancy and Failover: In high-availability setups, redundant PDUs can be used to ensure power redundancy and failover in case of PDU or power source failures. Dual power feeds from separate PDUs can be connected to devices with dual power supplies for added reliability.
    

PDUs come in different form factors, including basic PDUs (providing only power distribution) and intelligent PDUs (offering advanced features like monitoring and management). The selection of a PDU depends on factors such as the number of devices to be powered, power capacity requirements, and desired power management capabilities.
