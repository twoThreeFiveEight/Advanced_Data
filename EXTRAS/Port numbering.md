The "1/0/1" format used in the examples is a representation of a hierarchical port numbering system commonly used in Cisco switches. Let me break it down for better understanding:

In the "1/0/1" format:

- The first number (1) represents the slot or chassis number. It is used when the switch has multiple slots or chassis.
- The second number (0) represents the module or line card number. It is used when a slot or chassis has multiple modules or line cards.
- The third number (1) represents the specific port number within the module or line card.

So, in the example "1/0/1," it would mean the port is located in slot 1, module 0, and port 1. This format helps in identifying and organizing ports within a modular switch architecture.

It's important to note that this specific format is commonly used in Cisco switches, and other vendors may have different port numbering conventions. Always refer to the documentation or user manual of your specific switch model for accurate port naming conventions.
