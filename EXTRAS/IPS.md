IPS, or Intrusion Prevention System, is a type of network security tool or application that monitors network and/or system activities for malicious activity. The main function of an IPS is to identify suspicious actions, log the information, attempt to block or stop the activity, and report it to the network administrators.

IPS solutions are used to identify a variety of threats, such as network-based attacks, application-based attacks, and malware. They can detect unusual traffic patterns or protocol anomalies and take action based on pre-configured or adaptive policies.

The operation of an IPS can be aligned with several layers of the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model, depending on the type of analysis it performs:

1. **Network-based IPS (NIPS)**: These typically work at the Network Layer (Layer 3) and Transport Layer (Layer 4) of the OSI model. They analyze the packets that pass through the network, checking against known signatures of common attacks and identifying anomalies that could signal an attack.
    
2. **Host-based IPS (HIPS)**: These typically work at all layers, from the Physical Layer (Layer 1) to the Application Layer (Layer 7), as they monitor a single host for suspicious activity.
    
3. **Application Protocol-based IPS**: This type of IPS inspects traffic up to the Application Layer (Layer 7) of the OSI model. They can understand and analyze the specific protocols used in each application service, such as HTTP for web services and SMTP for email services.
    
4. **Stateful Protocol Analysis IPS**: This type of IPS identifies deviations of the characteristics of a single protocol by comparing observed events with “stateful” baseline conditions and can operate on various layers of the OSI model.
    

In summary, while many IPS systems work predominantly at the Network and Transport layers, more sophisticated systems can analyze traffic at the Application layer and even across multiple layers at once. This allows them to more accurately identify and prevent a broader range of attacks.
