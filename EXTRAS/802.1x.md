### Overview
---

802.1X is a network authentication protocol that provides a framework for port-based access control in wired and wireless networks. It is defined by the IEEE 802.1X standard and is widely used to enhance network security by authenticating and controlling access for devices attempting to connect to a network.

The 802.1X protocol operates in conjunction with an authentication server, typically using the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP). Here's how the process typically works:

1. When a device (such as a computer or mobile device) wants to connect to a network port or access point, it sends an initial request to connect.
    
2. The network switch or access point responds by enabling the port to allow only EAP traffic to pass through.
    
3. The device then sends an EAPOL (EAP over LAN) Start frame, indicating its desire to authenticate with the network.
    
4. The switch or access point relays this request to the authentication server.
    
5. The authentication server challenges the device to prove its identity using an authentication method supported by EAP, such as EAP-TLS (Transport Layer Security), EAP-PEAP (Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol), or EAP-MSCHAPv2 (Microsoft Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol version 2).
    
6. The device responds to the challenge by providing its credentials or a digital certificate to the authentication server.
    
7. The authentication server verifies the provided credentials and responds to the device and the switch or access point, indicating whether the authentication was successful or not.
    
8. If the authentication is successful, the switch or access point grants access to the network, and the device can start communicating on the network. If the authentication fails, access is denied, and the device is prevented from accessing the network.
    

By employing 802.1X, organizations can enforce user-based authentication and control access to their networks, thereby enhancing network security and preventing unauthorized access. It is commonly used in enterprise environments, educational institutions, and other settings where network access control is critical.

802.1X (dot1x) is not just a port configuration; it is a comprehensive network access control (NAC) protocol that involves multiple components and processes.

While port configuration is an essential part of implementing 802.1X, it is not the only aspect. Here's an overview of the key components involved in an 802.1X deployment:

1. Supplicant: The supplicant is the client device, such as a laptop, desktop, or mobile device, that seeks network access. It initiates the authentication process and communicates with the authenticator.
    
2. Authenticator: The authenticator is the network device, such as a switch or wireless access point, that controls access to the network port. It relays authentication requests from the supplicant to the authentication server.
    
3. Authentication Server: The authentication server, which can be Cisco ISE or another RADIUS server, is responsible for validating the supplicant's credentials and making an authentication decision.
    
4. RADIUS Protocol: 802.1X relies on the RADIUS protocol for communication between the authenticator and the authentication server. The RADIUS server (e.g., ISE) receives and processes the authentication requests, authenticates the supplicant, and provides an authorization response to the authenticator.
    
5. EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol): EAP is an authentication framework used within 802.1X to transport various authentication methods. It allows for flexibility in supporting different authentication mechanisms, such as username/password, digital certificates, smart cards, or biometrics.
    
6. Policies and Access Control: With 802.1X, the authentication server (ISE) can enforce access control policies based on user identity, device posture, location, and other attributes. These policies determine what network resources the authenticated supplicant can access.
    

Overall, 802.1X is a robust authentication framework that goes beyond port configuration. It provides a secure and flexible method for controlling network access based on user authentication and authorization decisions made by the authentication server.

### What is the Traffic Flow Protocol for Authentication?
---

The mechanism used by 802.1X to carry out the authentication process over the network is known as the EAPOL (Extensible Authentication Protocol over LAN) protocol. EAPOL is a protocol specifically designed for communication between the supplicant (client device) and the authenticator (network device) during the 802.1X authentication process.

EAPOL frames are encapsulated within Ethernet frames and are used to transport EAP messages between the supplicant and authenticator. These frames are exchanged over the LAN to facilitate the authentication and key exchange process.

The EAPOL protocol provides the following key functions:

1. Discovery: The supplicant and authenticator use EAPOL frames to discover each other's presence on the network. This helps initiate the authentication process.
    
2. Key Exchange: EAPOL frames are used to negotiate and exchange cryptographic keys between the supplicant and authenticator. These keys are required for securing the subsequent communication between the supplicant and the authentication server.
    
3. EAP Message Exchange: EAPOL carries EAP messages between the supplicant and the authentication server. These EAP messages contain the actual authentication protocol being used, such as EAP-TLS, EAP-PEAP, EAP-TTLS, or others.
    
4. Status and Control: EAPOL frames include status and control information, such as notification of successful or failed authentication, start or stop messages, and keep-alive messages to maintain the connection.
    

In summary, the EAPOL protocol is responsible for encapsulating and transporting EAP messages during the 802.1X authentication process. It facilitates the communication between the supplicant, authenticator, and authentication server, allowing for the exchange of authentication information and the establishment of secure network access.

### Handshake Process
---

The handshake order for authentication in the 802.1X protocol follows a specific sequence of steps. Here is a general overview of the handshake order: (EAPOL == Extensible Authentication Protocol Over LAN) 

1. Port Initialization: The supplicant (client device) connects to the network port on the authenticator (network device). The port is initially in a "Unauthorized" state, meaning no data can pass through.
    
2. Start (EAPOL-Start): The supplicant sends an EAPOL-Start frame to the authenticator, indicating its desire to initiate the authentication process.
    
3. Request Identity (EAP-Request/Identity): The authenticator responds with an EAP-Request/Identity frame, requesting the supplicant's identity. The supplicant then sends its identity information, such as a username, in an EAP-Response/Identity frame.
    
4. Response Identity (EAP-Response/Identity): The authenticator receives the supplicant's identity and forwards it to the authentication server (RADIUS server) for further processing.
    
5. Challenge and Response (EAP-Request/EAP-Response): The authentication server generates a challenge or request for further authentication. This challenge is sent to the supplicant through the authenticator in an EAP-Request frame. The supplicant responds with an EAP-Response frame containing the requested authentication information, such as a password or digital certificate.
    
6. Authentication Validation: The authenticator forwards the EAP-Response frame from the supplicant to the authentication server. The authentication server verifies the supplicant's credentials and responds with an authentication success or failure message to the authenticator.
    
7. Port Authorized/Unauthorized: If the authentication is successful, the authenticator changes the port state to "Authorized." Data traffic can now pass through the port, and the supplicant gains access to the network resources. If the authentication fails, the port remains in the "Unauthorized" state, and the supplicant's access is denied.
    

Please note that this is a general overview, and the specific details of the handshake may vary depending on the authentication method used (e.g., EAP-TLS, EAP-PEAP, etc.) and the configuration of the network devices involved.

If an authenticated device gets disconnected from a port and another unauthorized device is plugged into that same port, the behavior would depend on the configuration and settings of the network devices involved, specifically the authenticator (such as a switch or access point).

Here are two possible scenarios:

1. Reauthentication: If the network devices are configured for periodic reauthentication or dynamic port-based authentication, the new device that is plugged in will trigger a reauthentication process. The authenticator will send an EAPOL-Start frame to the new device, initiating the authentication process. The new device will need to provide valid credentials and successfully authenticate with the authentication server (RADIUS) to gain network access. If the authentication fails, the port may revert to an unauthorized state, and the new device will not be able to access network resources.
    
2. Persistent Authorization: If the network devices are configured for persistent authorization, the authenticated status of the previous device may remain associated with the port for a certain period of time, even after disconnection. In this case, the new device that is plugged in may continue to have access to the network resources without going through the authentication process. This behavior could be due to factors such as MAC address-based authentication or sticky MAC address configurations on the authenticator. It's important to note that persistent authorization configurations may vary depending on the specific network equipment and settings in use.
    

The specific behavior will be determined by the configuration and policies set on the network devices. It's crucial to properly configure the network devices to ensure that unauthorized devices do not gain access to the network resources. Implementing features such as port-based authentication, dynamic reauthentication, and proper access control policies will help mitigate unauthorized access.

#### 802.1X Wireless Authentication Traffic Flow

[Figure 1](https://www.arubanetworks.com/techdocs/ClearPass/6.9/Aruba_DeployGd_HTML/Content/802.1X%20Authentication/8021x_traffic_flows.htm#Wireless) shows the flow of traffic for 802.1X authentication using Active Directory.

#### Walking Through the 802.1X Authentication Process

Let's use an example to walk through the authentication process as illustrated in [Figure 1](https://www.arubanetworks.com/techdocs/ClearPass/6.9/Aruba_DeployGd_HTML/Content/802.1X%20Authentication/8021x_traffic_flows.htm#Wireless).

1. A Sales Dept. employee connects to the Aruba wireless network from her laptop and an 802.1X EAP-PEAP authentication process begins automatically.

EAP-PEAP (Protected Extensible Authentication Protocol) is the protocol used to communicate between the client and the network device, in this case, a mobility controller. For details, see .

2. The client's authentication request is sent to the mobility controller.

3. When the mobility controller receives the authentication request, it sends a RADIUS access-request packet to the Policy Manager server with the encrypted user name and password.

RADIUS is the protocol that network access device (NAD) authenticators use to communicate with the Policy Manager server in order to look up the information in the RADIUS database, which in this example is Active Directory.

4. The Policy Manager server checks the Active Directory database for a matching user name and password.

The communication between the Policy Manager server and Active Directory is via NT LAN Manager (NTLM) for authentication in conjunction with Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) for search and directory lookup.

If there is not a match, the Policy Manager server sends an access-reject message to the mobility controller and the Sales Dept. employee is denied access to the network.

If there is a match, the Policy Manager server sends an access-accept message to the mobility controller, and the Sales Dept. employee is granted access to the network.

#### User Role Attribute Information

The Policy Manager server can also send attribute information about the user (for example, User Role) to the mobility controller. In this example, the server uses the User Role attribute, which indicates that the user is in the Sales Department.

The mobility controller applies a Sales Department firewall role to this user's traffic. Typically for such a role, the firewall rule applied would be IP any permit, which permits all IP traffic.

#### 802.1X Wired Authentication Traffic Flow

This same process applies to wired clients that connect to an AOS switch or a third-party switch and perform 802.1X authentication to the Policy Manager server (see [Figure 2](https://www.arubanetworks.com/techdocs/ClearPass/6.9/Aruba_DeployGd_HTML/Content/802.1X%20Authentication/8021x_traffic_flows.htm#Wired)).

### Radius Server
---

A RADIUS (Remote Authentication Dial-In User Service) server is a network server that performs authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) functions for remote access or network access control. It is a centralized server that manages user authentication and access control policies for various network devices.

The RADIUS server acts as the authentication server in a RADIUS-based network infrastructure. When a user attempts to access a network resource, such as connecting to a Wi-Fi network or accessing a VPN, the network device (such as a wireless access point or VPN gateway) forwards the authentication request to the RADIUS server.

The RADIUS server then verifies the user's credentials against its local user database or external identity sources such as LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) or Active Directory. If the user authentication is successful, the RADIUS server sends an authentication response to the network device, granting access to the requested resource. It may also include authorization attributes specifying the level of access granted to the user.

Additionally, the RADIUS server can perform accounting functions, such as logging authentication and access-related information for auditing and billing purposes.

RADIUS servers support various authentication methods, including username/password, digital certificates, one-time passwords, and more. They also provide a standardized protocol for communication between the network devices and the server, ensuring interoperability across different vendor products.

Some popular RADIUS server software includes FreeRADIUS, Microsoft Network Policy Server (NPS), Cisco ISE (Identity Services Engine), and many other commercial and open-source implementations.
