#### What is a Demarcation Point or Demarc?

- A demarcation point (sometimes referred to as demarc, dmarc, point of demarcation, or network boundary point) is the physical point where the public switched telephone network ends and a customer’s personal network or the private network of an organization or business begins.
	- Essentially, this point of entry is where a phone company’s wiring meets a subscriber’s wiring, and serves as a physical representation of which part of the network is public and which part is private.

#### Patch Panel
---
a patch panel is not typically located outside the building connecting the service. A patch panel is an internal network component commonly found within a data center, server room, or network wiring closet.

A patch panel serves as a central termination point for multiple network cables, allowing for organized and structured connectivity. It consists of multiple ports or sockets where network cables can be terminated and connected. The patch panel provides a convenient and manageable interface for connecting various devices, such as servers, switches, routers, and other networking equipment.

The primary purpose of a patch panel is to simplify network management and facilitate easy changes, additions, or troubleshooting. By connecting cables to the patch panel, it becomes easier to route, label, and document network connections, reducing cable clutter and simplifying maintenance tasks.

The connection between the external service and the building typically involves other network components such as the demarcation point or service entrance. The demarcation point is where the external service provider's network terminates and connects to the building's internal network infrastructure. It is usually located near the building's entry point and may involve equipment like an outdoor junction box or a network interface device (NID).

In summary, while a patch panel is an internal network component used for cable termination and organization, the connection between the external service and the building typically involves other network components located outside the building, such as the demarcation point or service entrance.
