In networking, the term "campus" refers to a specific type of network environment. A campus network is a localized network infrastructure that connects various buildings and facilities within a specific geographic area, typically a university campus, corporate campus, or a large organization's premises.

A campus network is designed to provide network connectivity and services to a concentrated area, enabling communication and data sharing among different departments, offices, and users within the campus. It is often characterized by a high-density user population, diverse network devices, and a wide range of applications and services.

Key features of a campus network include:

1.  Local Area Network (LAN): A campus network typically consists of multiple LANs that interconnect buildings or departments within the campus. These LANs provide connectivity for devices and users in close proximity.
    
2.  Network Segmentation: Campus networks often utilize network segmentation techniques, such as VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks), to logically separate different user groups or departments while sharing the same physical network infrastructure.
    
3.  Network Hierarchy: Campus networks are usually structured hierarchically, with core, distribution, and access layers. This layered architecture allows for efficient traffic routing, scalability, and centralized management.
    
4.  Network Services: Campus networks support a variety of network services and applications, including internet access, email, file sharing, printing, video conferencing, and collaboration tools.
    
5.  Network Security: Security is a critical aspect of campus networks. They employ security measures such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems, access control, and authentication mechanisms to protect sensitive data and ensure network integrity.
    
6.  Wireless Connectivity: Due to the mobile nature of campus users, wireless access points are often deployed throughout the campus to provide seamless connectivity to laptops, smartphones, and other wireless devices.
    

Campus networks are designed to meet the specific needs of an organization or educational institution by providing reliable and scalable connectivity, supporting collaboration and resource sharing, and accommodating the diverse requirements of different departments or buildings within the campus environment.
