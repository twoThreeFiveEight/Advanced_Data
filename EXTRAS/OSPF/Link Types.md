The link types are passed inside the LSA type 1 (router LSA) and stay within an area.

|Link Type|Description|Link ID|
|---|---|---|
|1|Point-to-point connection to another router.|Neighbor router ID|
|2|Connection to transit network.|IP address of DR|
|3|Connection to stub network.|IP Network|
|4|Virtual Link|Neighbor router ID|


In OSPF (Open Shortest Path First), there are several link types used to establish communication between routers. Here's an explanation of each link type:

1. Point-to-Point Connection: This link type refers to a direct connection between two routers. It typically occurs when two routers are connected through a dedicated link, such as a serial connection. In OSPF, when routers establish a point-to-point connection, they become neighbors. The "Neighbor router ID" refers to the router ID of the neighboring router. a point-to-point connection only establishes a neighbor relationship between the directly connected routers. It does not automatically share or exchange information about the connected subnets.
    
2. Connection to Transit Network: A transit network is a network that acts as a transit point for routing traffic between different routers or networks. When a router is connected to a transit network, it participates in OSPF by exchanging routing information with other routers connected to the same network. In this case, the OSPF Designated Router (DR) and Backup Designated Router (BDR) are elected to represent the network. The "IP address of DR" refers to the IP address assigned to the DR.
    
3. Connection to Stub Network: A stub network is a network with only one exit point, usually connected to a single router. When a router is connected to a stub network, it advertises the network's presence to other routers in the OSPF domain. The "IP Network" refers to the IP address and subnet mask that define the stub network.
    
4. Virtual Link: A virtual link is used to connect two areas in OSPF when a direct physical link between them is not available. It allows traffic to be routed through intermediate areas to reach the destination. The virtual link is established between two routers, and the "Neighbor router ID" refers to the router ID of the router at the other end of the virtual link.
    

These link types help OSPF routers build and maintain their routing tables, allowing efficient communication and path selection within an OSPF network.
