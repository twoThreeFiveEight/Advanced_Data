LSDB stands for Link-State Database in OSPF (Open Shortest Path First). The Link-State Database is a key component of OSPF and is maintained by each OSPF router within an OSPF routing domain. It contains a collection of link-state advertisements (LSAs) that describe the router's view of the network's topology.

Each router participating in OSPF maintains its own LSDB, which stores LSAs received from neighboring routers. The LSDB provides a comprehensive representation of the network's topology, including information about routers, networks, and links within the OSPF domain.

The LSDB contains various types of LSAs, such as:

1. Router LSA (Type 1): Generated by each router to describe its own state, interfaces, and neighbors.
    
2. Network LSA (Type 2): Generated by the designated router (DR) on a multi-access network to describe the connected network and the participating routers.
    
3. Summary LSA (Type 3 and Type 4): Generated by the area border routers (ABRs) to summarize inter-area and external routes and advertise them to other areas.
    
4. AS-external LSA (Type 5): Generated by the autonomous system boundary router (ASBR) to advertise routes from outside the OSPF domain into the OSPF network.
    

By maintaining the LSDB, OSPF routers have a consistent view of the network's topology. This information is used by the OSPF routing algorithm to calculate the shortest path to destination networks and build the routing table.

Whenever there is a change in the network topology, such as a link failure or a new router coming online, routers exchange LSAs to update their LSDBs and ensure that they have an up-to-date view of the network. This enables OSPF to dynamically adapt to changes and calculate the shortest paths for efficient routing within the network.
