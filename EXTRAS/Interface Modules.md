The removable ports on a switch are commonly referred to as "modules" or "interface modules." These modules provide the physical connectivity for different types of network interfaces and can be inserted or removed from the switch as needed.

Switches often come with modular slots that allow for the installation of different types of modules, such as Ethernet modules, fiber optic modules, or expansion modules. These modules provide the specific ports required for different network connectivity options.

For example, a switch may have modular slots that allow you to insert Ethernet modules with RJ-45 ports for connecting devices via copper Ethernet cables, or fiber optic modules with SFP (Small Form-Factor Pluggable) ports for connecting devices over fiber optic cables.

By using modular ports, network administrators have the flexibility to customize the switch's connectivity options based on their specific network requirements.

### Examples:
----

#### Line cards:
- typically sold with a specific type of port option per card. Each line card is designed to accommodate a particular type of network interface, such as Ethernet, fiber optic, or other specialized protocols
- modular switches are designed to accommodate interface cards or line cards

#### Interface cards
- Same as Line card info just smaller.
- modular switches are designed to accommodate interface cards or line cards

### NOTE:
----
Fixed-configuration switches: These switches come with a fixed number of built-in ports and do not support interchangeable interface cards. They are typically more cost-effective and simpler in design, but they have limited flexibility for expanding or changing connectivity options. Fixed-configuration switches are often used for smaller networks or specific use cases where a fixed number of ports is sufficient.
