##### GlobalProtect is a secure remote access solution that enables users to connect to corporate networks and resources from outside the organization's physical premises. 

"GlobalProtect" is a feature provided by Palo Alto Networks, a cybersecurity company, as part of their Next-Generation Firewall (NGFW) platform. 

GlobalProtect offers several capabilities that enhance the security and accessibility of remote connections:

1. Secure VPN Connectivity: GlobalProtect establishes a Virtual Private Network (VPN) tunnel between remote users and the corporate network. This encrypted tunnel ensures that data transmitted between the user's device and the corporate network is secure and protected from unauthorized access.
    
2. User Authentication and Authorization: GlobalProtect integrates with the organization's authentication infrastructure, such as Active Directory or RADIUS servers, to authenticate remote users. This ensures that only authorized individuals can access the corporate network resources.
    
3. Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): GlobalProtect supports two-factor authentication, requiring users to provide an additional authentication factor, such as a security token or biometric verification, in addition to their username and password. This adds an extra layer of security to remote access.
    
4. Host Security and Compliance Checks: GlobalProtect can enforce security policies on remote devices to ensure they meet specific security requirements before allowing access to the corporate network. It can verify factors such as up-to-date antivirus software, operating system patches, and adherence to security policies.
    
5. Threat Prevention: GlobalProtect integrates with Palo Alto Networks' threat prevention capabilities, including intrusion prevention systems (IPS), antivirus, and advanced malware protection. This ensures that remote connections are protected from known and unknown threats.
    
6. Clientless Access: GlobalProtect supports clientless access for web applications, allowing users to securely access web-based resources without the need to install additional software on their devices.
    

Overall, GlobalProtect provides organizations with a secure and flexible remote access solution, enabling employees to connect to corporate networks and resources while maintaining the highest levels of security. It helps protect against unauthorized access, secures data transmission, and ensures compliance with security policies.
