A workgroup bridge, also known as a WGB, is a network device that enables wired devices to connect to a wireless network. It acts as a bridge or intermediary between the wired and wireless networks, allowing devices that only have Ethernet connectivity to communicate with devices on a wireless network.

The primary purpose of a workgroup bridge is to extend the range of a wireless network by providing a wireless connection to devices that are located beyond the reach of the wireless access point (AP). It enables those devices to communicate with the rest of the network without the need for additional wiring.

A workgroup bridge typically has one or more Ethernet ports to which wired devices can be connected. It also has a wireless radio that can connect to the wireless network. When a wired device is connected to the workgroup bridge, it uses the wireless connection to communicate with the rest of the network.

Workgroup bridges are commonly used in situations where it is impractical or cost-prohibitive to run Ethernet cables to all devices. For example, in a large office building or a warehouse, deploying Ethernet cables to every device may be challenging. Instead, workgroup bridges can be strategically placed to provide wireless connectivity to those devices.

It's important to note that workgroup bridges are not as common as they once were. With the advancement of technology, wireless access points often have built-in bridging capabilities, eliminating the need for a separate workgroup bridge device.
