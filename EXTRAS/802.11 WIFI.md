802.11 is a Wifi IEEE standard which is a set of Protocols that specify the sort of communications that can on a wifi network on various frequencies,

802.11n (2009) = Wi-Fi 4
802.11ac (2014) = Wi-Fi 5
802.11ax (2019) = Wi-Fi 6

ISM = (industrial, Science, and medical bands) Bands that you can use without a license. Wifi is a ISM band.

### 2.4 GHz Frequency space

- The only channels that do not overlap other channels are:
	- 1
	- 6
	- 11

- In the Issues with interference from Adjacent channels below is where selecting the proper channels become crucial.
- Co-channel congestion is preferable to adjacent channel congestion because of the way the wireless conversations are managed. As mentioned above, when choosing a channel that has other networks active, try to keep at least 20 dB between the RSSI 1 (Received Signal Strength Indicator) levels of the networks
	- In telecommunications, received signal strength indicator (RSSI) is a measurement of the power present in a received radio signal. RSSI is usually invisible to a user of a receiving device

#### 3 main causes of WIFI interference

- Co Channel
	- too many devices on same channel. Devices compete for time to talk on the same channel
	- to explain co-channel congestion, we’ll move our imaginary conversation from a  concert venue to a classroom. Think back to your school days – chances are you can think of at least one class that had a student who would talk slower than the other kids, and everyone else would have to wait for their turn to ask a question. Co-channel congestion works in a similar manner: the performance is hindered by the wait times, but the bandwidth is managed, and every device will get a chance to talk to its associated AP
- Adjacent Channel
	- Access points producing signals that are to close to other devices. Waves overlap and create a mushed signal.
	- To illustrate, think about  being at a concert in the Garden – there's a band playing really loud, and tons of people, each with their own group of friends. With this much going on, it's difficult to talk to your friends, and when you start to talk louder, the person next to you has to raise his voice to talk to their group
- Non-Wi-Fi
	- Devices that can add interferance to the Wi-Fi signal.
		- cordless phones
		- anolog camera
		- microwaves

the sentence in the first paragraph indicates that the entire 2.4 GHz spectrum is only 100 MHz wide. This means that all the channels, which are each 20 MHz wide, have to fit within the available 100 MHz spectrum. As a result, there is overlap between the channels since the total width of the channels (11 channels * 20 MHz each = 220 MHz) exceeds the width of the spectrum (100 MHz).
