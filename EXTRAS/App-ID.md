The term "App-ID" is primarily associated with Palo Alto Networks, a cybersecurity company known for its next-generation firewall (NGFW) solutions. Palo Alto Networks developed and popularized the concept of App-ID as a core feature of their firewalls.

"App-ID" stands for Application Identifier. It is a term commonly used in the field of network security and firewall configurations.

In the context of network security and firewalls, an App-ID refers to a technology or method used to identify and classify applications running on a network. It helps in detecting and controlling network traffic based on the specific application or service being used.

Firewalls equipped with App-ID capabilities can inspect network packets and identify the applications or protocols involved in the communication. This identification is based on various attributes such as port numbers, packet patterns, behavior analysis, and other characteristics specific to different applications.

With the ability to identify applications, network administrators can implement granular policies to allow, deny, or control specific applications or categories of applications. This helps in enforcing security measures, optimizing network performance, and managing bandwidth allocation based on application requirements.

App-ID is often used in next-generation firewalls (NGFW) and unified threat management (UTM) solutions, where it forms a part of the overall security and network management capabilities. By leveraging App-ID, organizations can gain better visibility and control over the applications being used on their networks.
