IPAM stands for IP Address Management. It refers to the process of planning, tracking, and managing IP addresses (both IPv4 and IPv6) within a network infrastructure. IPAM solutions provide centralized tools and systems to efficiently manage IP address allocation, assignment, and tracking.

The main goals of IPAM include:

1.  IP Address Inventory: IPAM solutions maintain a comprehensive inventory of all IP addresses within the network, including details such as the status (used or available), subnet assignments, and associated metadata.
    
2.  IP Address Allocation: IPAM enables automated allocation and assignment of IP addresses to devices and systems within the network. It helps ensure efficient utilization of IP address space and minimizes conflicts or overlapping IP assignments.
    
3.  Subnet Management: IPAM allows the creation and management of subnets, enabling administrators to define network segments and allocate IP addresses accordingly. It assists in subnet planning, subnet delegation, and subnet utilization monitoring.
    
4.  DNS and DHCP Integration: IPAM solutions often integrate with DNS (Domain Name System) and DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) services, facilitating coordinated management of IP addresses, DNS records, and DHCP lease assignments.
    
5.  IP Address Tracking and Audit: IPAM systems provide tracking and audit capabilities to monitor IP address usage, changes, and historical allocation records. This helps with troubleshooting, compliance, and security-related activities.
    
6.  Reporting and Analytics: IPAM tools generate reports and analytics to provide insights into IP address utilization, trends, and potential issues. This helps administrators make informed decisions regarding IP address management and planning.
    

IPAM solutions can range from standalone software applications to integrated features within network management systems. They offer a streamlined approach to IP address management, promoting efficiency, accuracy, and better control over IP address resources in a network environment.
