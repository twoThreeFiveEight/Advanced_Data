System time zones for computers use abbreviations to represent the standard time and daylight saving time in a particular zone. The abbreviations usually follow this format: `Standard Time Abbreviation<UTC offset>Daylight Saving Time Abbreviation`.

Here's how to interpret it:

- The first part before the number (`CST` in `CST6CDT`) is the abbreviation for the standard (non-daylight saving) time. `CST` stands for Central Standard Time.
    
- The number (`6` in `CST6CDT`) indicates the offset from Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). In this case, `6` means the time is 6 hours behind UTC during standard time.
    
- The last part (`CDT` in `CST6CDT`) is the abbreviation for the daylight saving time. `CDT` stands for Central Daylight Time.
    

So `CST6CDT` represents Central Time, which is 6 hours behind UTC during standard time, and uses Central Daylight Time during the daylight saving period.

Some other examples:

- `PST8PDT` represents Pacific Time, which is 8 hours behind UTC during standard time and uses Pacific Daylight Time during the daylight saving period.
    
- `EST5EDT` represents Eastern Time, which is 5 hours behind UTC during standard time and uses Eastern Daylight Time during the daylight saving period.
    

Remember, not all regions observe daylight saving time, so not all time zone abbreviations will have both parts. For instance, `UTC0` is used for Coordinated Universal Time, which doesn't observe daylight saving time.
