SNMP stands for Simple Network Management Protocol. It is a widely used protocol in network management systems to monitor and manage network devices. SNMP is a standard of the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and is used for collecting information from, and configuring, network devices, such as servers, printers, hubs, switches, and routers on an Internet Protocol (IP) network.

The protocol consists of a set of standards for network management, including an application layer protocol, a database schema, and a set of data objects.

SNMP provides a toolset for the management of network devices, and it's used by network administrators to manage and monitor network performance, find and solve network issues, and plan for network growth.

In practice, SNMP works by sending protocol data units (PDUs) to different parts of a network. Devices that have an SNMP agent can respond to these requests by providing the requested information or performing the action required.

There are several versions of SNMP, including:

- SNMPv1, the original version, which is widely used but lacks certain security features.
- SNMPv2c, which is an update to SNMPv2, and includes improvements in network management but still lacks certain security features.
- SNMPv3, which added security features to prevent unauthorized access, unauthorized modifications, and message replay attacks.

The most significant enhancement in SNMPv3 is that it can ensure both the authenticity and the encryption of the management messages.
