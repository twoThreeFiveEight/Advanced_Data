VXLAN, short for Virtual Extensible LAN, is a network virtualization technology that allows the creation of virtual networks over an existing physical network infrastructure. It was developed to address the scalability limitations of traditional VLANs (Virtual LANs) in large-scale cloud computing environments.

VXLAN extends Layer 2 Ethernet networks over Layer 3 IP networks, enabling the creation of logical networks that span across multiple physical networks or data centers. It uses encapsulation techniques to tunnel Layer 2 frames within IP packets, allowing virtual machines (VMs) or network segments to communicate with each other as if they were part of the same LAN.

The key components of VXLAN are as follows:

1.  VXLAN Tunnel Endpoint (VTEP): A VTEP is a device, such as a switch or a router, that terminates VXLAN tunnels. It encapsulates and de-encapsulates Ethernet frames into IP packets for transmission across the underlying IP network.
    
2.  VXLAN Network Identifier (VNI): Each virtual network is identified by a unique 24-bit VXLAN Network Identifier (VNI). The VNI acts as a segmentation identifier, allowing multiple virtual networks to coexist over the same physical infrastructure.
    
3.  UDP Encapsulation: VXLAN frames are encapsulated within UDP (User Datagram Protocol) packets. This enables VXLAN traffic to traverse Layer 3 networks, including the Internet, while maintaining compatibility with existing network equipment.
    
4.  VXLAN Gateway: A VXLAN gateway or bridge connects VXLAN virtual networks with traditional VLANs or other non-VXLAN networks. It facilitates communication between virtual and physical resources in heterogeneous environments.
    

VXLAN provides several benefits, including increased scalability, improved network isolation, flexible workload mobility, and support for multi-tenancy in cloud environments. It has gained popularity in data centers and cloud deployments as a means to create large, agile, and isolated virtual networks that can span across geographically dispersed locations.
