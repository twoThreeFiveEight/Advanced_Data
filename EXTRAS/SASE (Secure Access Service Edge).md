SASE, or Secure Access Service Edge, is a network architecture model proposed by Gartner in 2019. It combines wide area networking, or WAN, and network security services into a single, cloud-based service model.

The goal of SASE is to provide simplified management and improved performance for WAN activities. It is particularly relevant for businesses adopting cloud-based services, as well as for those with a distributed workforce that needs access to resources from different locations, including from home or other remote places.

The SASE model converges the following functions:

- **Networking Capabilities**: These include Software-defined Wide Area Networking (SD-WAN), Wide Area Networking optimization, routing, and other network functions.
    
- **Security Capabilities**: These include Firewall-as-a-Service (FWaaS), Secure Web Gateway (SWG), Zero Trust Network Access (ZTNA), Data Loss Prevention (DLP), and other security functions.
    

By offering these functions as a cloud service, SASE aims to provide the necessary security policies and network capabilities regardless of the userâ€™s location, the source of the application (which could be in a public cloud, private cloud, or data center), or the specifics of the device accessing the resources.

One of the key characteristics of SASE is that it is identity-driven. This means that security policies are dynamically adjusted based on the identity of the entity, which could be a user or a device, and the context of the access (such as the location, time, risk level of the device, sensitivity of the data, etc.).

Keep in mind that SASE is a relatively new concept and many vendors are in the process of aligning their offerings to this model. As with any emerging technology, it's important to carefully evaluate the capabilities and maturity of different solutions when considering a move to SASE.
