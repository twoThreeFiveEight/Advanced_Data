In the context of network design for businesses, the terms "single-layer network" and "multi-layer network" are not commonly used. However, I can provide an overview of network designs commonly implemented in business environments.

1.  Flat or Single-Tier Network: In this design, all devices in the network are connected to a single switch or hub. It is a simple and cost-effective design suitable for small businesses with a limited number of devices. However, it can result in network congestion and limited scalability as the number of devices and network traffic increases.
    
2.  Two-Tier Network: This design involves dividing the network into two layers. The first layer consists of access switches that connect end-user devices such as computers, printers, and phones. The second layer consists of distribution switches that aggregate the connections from the access switches and provide connectivity to the core network or servers. This design allows for better scalability and management of network traffic.
    
3.  Three-Tier Network: This design further divides the network into three layers. The access layer connects end-user devices, the distribution layer aggregates connections from access switches and provides routing and VLAN services, and the core layer handles high-speed switching and routing. The three-tier network design provides improved scalability, fault tolerance, and better management of network resources.
    

The choice of network design depends on factors such as the size of the organization, the number of devices, the expected network traffic, scalability requirements, and budget considerations. It is important to design the network architecture based on the specific needs of the business to ensure reliable and efficient connectivity
