The phrase "case of IPv4 networks running on Ethernet" refers to the specific scenario where IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) is used as the network layer protocol, and Ethernet is the underlying technology used for data transmission within the network.

In this case, Ethernet is the physical and data link layer protocol responsible for carrying the IP packets across the network. IPv4, on the other hand, is the network layer protocol that provides the addressing and routing functionality, allowing devices to communicate with each other over an Ethernet network.

In an IPv4 network running on Ethernet, devices are assigned unique IPv4 addresses, typically in the form of four sets of numbers separated by periods (e.g., 192.168.0.1). These addresses are used to identify devices within the network and facilitate communication between them.

When a device wants to send data to another device in the same network, it encapsulates the data into an IP packet, which includes the source and destination IPv4 addresses. The device then uses the Ethernet protocol to encapsulate the IP packet into an Ethernet frame, which includes the source and destination MAC (Media Access Control) addresses.

The Ethernet frame is then transmitted over the Ethernet network, with the MAC addresses used to ensure that the frame reaches the intended destination device. Upon receiving the frame, the receiving device extracts the IP packet from the Ethernet frame and processes it at the network layer to deliver the data to the appropriate higher-layer protocols or applications.

Overall, the phrase "case of IPv4 networks running on Ethernet" simply describes the specific combination of using IPv4 as the network layer protocol and Ethernet as the underlying technology for data transmission within the network. This combination is widely used in many networks today, as Ethernet provides a reliable and widely supported medium for carrying IPv4 traffic.
