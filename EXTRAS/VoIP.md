### Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP)
----

Phone ports typically do not require gigabit Ethernet speeds. Most modern IP phones typically use Fast Ethernet (10/100 Mbps) ports, which are sufficient for voice communication. These ports provide enough bandwidth for voice traffic without the need for higher speeds.

The type of port you need for connecting phones depends on the specific phone model and its interface options. IP phones commonly have Ethernet ports (RJ-45), which can be connected to the network using standard Ethernet cables. Some phones may also have additional ports for features like Power over Ethernet (PoE) or connecting peripherals like headsets.

Regarding the connectivity, it is common to attach phones to the same switch and router that your network uses. IP phones rely on the same network infrastructure as other devices to establish connections with the VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) server or PBX (Private Branch Exchange) system. By connecting phones to the network switch, they can communicate with other devices on the network, including the router, for Internet access and VoIP services.
